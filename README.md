# Handwritten Digit Classifier with PyTorch

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YourUsername/MNIST-Digit-Classifier-PyTorch/blob/main/your_notebook.ipynb)


This project implements a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using **PyTorch**.  
It was trained and tested in **Google Colab** with GPU acceleration.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open the project notebook in Google Colab.  
2. Make sure GPU is enabled (`Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU`).  
3. Run all cells (`Runtime > Run all`).  
4. The model will train for 5 epochs and report accuracy on the test set.
